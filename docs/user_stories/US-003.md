# US-003: User Can Submit DNI and Name via Web Form

| Status | DONE |

## Description
As a user of the CBTC Media Day application I want to provide my DNI and Name through a web form so that I can interact with the backend service through a user-friendly interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
Scenario: User sees the form with required fields
  Given the web application is loaded
  When I navigate to the form page
  Then I should see a text input for "DNI"
  And I should see a text input for "Nombre"
  And I should see a button labeled "Enviar"
```

```
Scenario: User can submit valid DNI and Name
  Given the web application is loaded
  And I have entered "12345678A" in the DNI field
  And I have entered "ValidUser" in the Nombre field
  When I click the "Enviar" button
  Then the form data should be sent to the backend API
  And I should receive a successful response
```

```
Scenario: User receives feedback after submission
  Given the web application is loaded
  And I have entered valid DNI and Name
  When I click the "Enviar" button
  Then I should see a success message or greeting response
```
