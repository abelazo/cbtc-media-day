# US-001: User Can Get a Personalized Greeting

**Status**: Completed (Example)

## Description

As a user of the CBTC Media Day application, I want to receive a personalized greeting when I call the API, so that I can confirm the service is working and responsive to my input.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User can call the API without parameters and receive a default greeting "Hello, World!"
2. User can provide a `name` query parameter and receive a personalized greeting "Hello, {name}!"
3. The API returns proper HTTP status codes (200 for success) and JSON responses
4. The API includes proper CORS headers for cross-origin access
5. Errors are handled gracefully with appropriate error messages

## Impact / Rationale

This is a foundational example service that demonstrates:
- The TDD workflow (functional test → unit tests → implementation)
- Proper Lambda handler structure
- API Gateway integration patterns
- Error handling best practices

This serves as a template for all future services in the project.
