# US-001: User Can Get a Personalized Greeting

| Status | DONE |

## Description
As a user of the CBTC Media Day application I want to receive a personalized greeting when I call the API so that I can confirm the service is working and responsive to my input.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
Scenario: User receives default greeting
  Given the API Gateway is deployed
  When I send a GET request to the content endpoint without parameters
  Then the response status code should be 200
  And the response body should contain "Hello, World!"
```

```
Scenario: User receives personalized greeting
  Given the API Gateway is deployed
  When I send a GET request to the content endpoint with parameter name="TestUser"
  Then the response status code should be 200
  And the response body should contain "Hello, TestUser!"
```

```
Scenario: API returns proper JSON response
  Given the API Gateway is deployed
  When I send a GET request to the content endpoint with parameter name="Alice"
  Then the response status code should be 200
  And the response header "Content-Type" should be "application/json"
  And the response body should contain "message"
  And the response body should contain "success"
```
