# US-002: Basic Auth for Content Service

| Status | IN PROGRESS |

## Description
As a user of the CBTC Media Day application I want to receive the greeting message if and only if I send the proper basic auth header so that access to the service is restricted.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
Scenario: User receives greeting with valid credentials
  Given the content service is deployed
  And a user "ValidUser" with password "password123" exists in the database
  When I send a GET request to the content endpoint with Basic Auth "ValidUser:password123"
  Then the response status code should be 200
```

```
Scenario: User denied access with invalid credentials
  Given the content service is deployed
  When I send a GET request to the content endpoint with Basic Auth "InvalidUser:wrongpassword"
  Then the response status code should be 401
```

```
Scenario: User denied access without credentials
  Given the content service is deployed
  When I send a GET request to the content endpoint without Basic Auth header
  Then the response status code should be 401
```
